Since my obsession with this game merged into a stereo-obsession with the band who made the music, Sea Power (a.k.a. British Sea Power until 2021), I've spent some time learning the connections between their different tracks, noting them down and also tagging what I find on MusicBrainz, e.g. [here](https://musicbrainz.org/release/61d0dba6-1cfb-440b-a0bd-c3429c941db1).

I've found a post with some [pre-existing counterparts](https://www.reddit.com/r/DiscoElysium/comments/hqc6wb/disco_elysium_ost_tracks_and_their_preexisting/) and one about [references](https://www.reddit.com/r/DiscoElysium/comments/ofgjul/british_sea_power_references/) but neither seemed to have everything and I wanted to assemble it all into one place here.

There are also some articles ([techradar](https://www.techradar.com/news/disco-elysium-how-cult-heroes-british-sea-power-wrote-its-bafta-nominated-score), [nintendolife](https://www.nintendolife.com/features/meet-sea-power-the-talent-behind-disco-elysiums-exquisite-music), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/mar/14/the-odd-drunken-detective-has-been-sighted-at-gigs-how-sea-power-won-legions-of-gamer-fans)) with context about the soundtrack, and [a clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRnptZ8dXvA) from a video interview with Argo Tuulik by The 41st Precint.

Robert Kurvitz reached out to the band to work on the game, with an extensive knowledge of their body of work and already with ideas of how some of their old tracks could set the tone for moments in the game. They met up and Kurvitz was at some live shows and was provided with demos. Sea Power already had a pattern of taking their existing songs from multiple different albums, fitting them to a soundtrack, and reworking them together to create a cohesive whole with a new sound, which they used on the three soundtracks produced prior to Disco.

**Soundtrack**

* [*Instrument of Surrender*](https://youtube.com/watch?v=qMUoWTEIGx4), [*Detective Arriving on the Scene*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxevPfOxCaU), and [*ZA/UM*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dhSWZTpwyE) (general overworld music, mostly in the area east of the water lock) - These are all based on [*Red Rock Riviera*](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NSkb5OtTmgg) and [*Cleaning out the Rooms*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yqf-92FNGv4).
   * *Cleaning out the Rooms* appears on [*Valhalla Dancehall*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Dancehall) (2011) and the preceding EP [*Zeus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus_(EP)) (2010). *Red Rock Riviera* is an extension and reworking of the track, for their soundtrack to the BBC archive footage documentary [*From the Sea to the Land Beyond*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_Sea_to_the_Land_Beyond) (2013). You can also hear some similar horns on [*Monsters of Sunderland*](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1yE0goo9Eig) from [*Machinieries of Joy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machineries_of_Joy) (2013).
   * *Instrument of Surrender* is focused on the horns section, *Detective Arriving on the Scene* is more from the main part of the song, and *ZA/UM* has a lot of the gentle and melancholy piano from the end of the song (which is the focus of the original *Cleaning out the Rooms* [instrumental demo](https://seapower.bandcamp.com/track/cleaning-out-the-rooms-original-instrumental-piano-demo)).
   * *Cleaning out the Rooms* is also directly referenced in the  game (more below).
   * There's a beautiful [music video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1Q-IgHnuWs)on the official Sea Power channel made with a montage of  art submitted by the community.
* The *Whirling-In-Rags* theme ([8 AM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeILSPhyExw), [8 PM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sTwNN8uAGc), [12 PM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWUHZgEe5M)) is based on [*Up Against It*](https://seapower.bandcamp.com/track/up-against-it) from [*BSP EP 2*](https://seapower.bandcamp.com/album/gcr007-bsp-ep2)*.*
   * The track from Disco Elysium has also been adapted forward into a song, [*Fire Escape In The Sea*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdSYXpC2sd8), on their newest album, [*Everything was Forever*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_Was_Forever) (2022). It features the lyrics from the EP version with some tweaks, along with an instrumental closer to the Disco version.
   * You can also find a [demo](https://seapower.bandcamp.com/track/fire-escape-in-the-sea-demo) for the 2022 version, and an alternative, [*Fire Escape In The Sea (3 AM)*](https://seapower.bandcamp.com/track/fire-escape-in-the-sea-3am).
   * Sea Power has a [video with gameplay footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUDpm4zD-ag) for the song, and later a [montage of community art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNwd56ZhoPI) like the one for *Cleaning out the Rooms*.
   * *BSP EP 2* is one of a series of six demo EPs that had limited releases only at their club nights, but are now thankfully available on Bandcamp. Some of the EP tracks, like *Monsters of Sunderland,* went on to form the basic for the *Machineries of Joy* album.
* [*Tiger King*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=870j0RZhRD4) from the dream sequences is based on [*Tiger King*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUH7nuWuPdE) from their soundtrack [*Man of Aran*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_of_Aran_(album)) (2009).
   * The 2009 soundtrack was a new original score for the 1934 film [*Man of Aran*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_of_Aran).
   * It's totally unrelated to the Netflix documentary, which the score and original film both obviously predate. The film just happens to feature someone named Colman 'Tiger' King.
   todo where to watch the movie
* [*The Insulinian Miracle*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WtcWc2PNG0) (Joyce's theme) is based on [*Praise for Whatever*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbTCVcPU_zg) from [*Let the Dancers Inherit the Party*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_the_Dancers_Inherit_the_Party) (2017), their album that game out directly before the game, which they were probably working on at the same time.
* [*Live With Me*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5styNnAZ4w), which plays in the fishing village shack and the Working Class Woman's apartment, [*The Field Autopsy*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kocs8BXOtQg), which plays in the Whirling's backyard, and most famously [*Burn, Baby, Burn*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuONWv9O588), which plays on the boat ride to the island, are all based on [*Want To Be Free*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GcsQGVGtPU), also from *Let the Dancers Inherit the Party*.
   * You can listen to a [demo](https://seapower.bandcamp.com/track/want-to-be-free-demo) of the song, and, interestingly, a [remix](https://seapower.bandcamp.com/track/want-to-be-free-remix) from the expanded boxset which is basically verbatim the version from Disco.
   * *Burn, Baby, Burn* also quotes from the actual disco song [*Disco Inferno*](https://youtube.com/watch?v=A_sY2rjxq6M) (1976) by The Trammps.
* Now we get to some of the more obscure connections. [*The Cryptozoologists*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB0807je9mg) does not appear in the game, but is similar to [*La Revacholiere*](https://youtube.com/watch?v=54moBCJSfXg), which plays on the island. The sound at the end of *The Cryptozoologists* is very recognisably from [*Lately*](https://youtube.com/watch?v=7RgYJEVGaOE), which appears on Sea Power's debut album [*The Decline of British Sea Power*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decline_of_British_Sea_Power) (2003).
   * I don't really know anything about music theory, but I think the the overall motif of the whole track is actually based on *Lately*.
   * I also suspect that [*Ecstatic Vibrations, Totally Transcendent*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knOXppaqBYY) (the ravers' music) in fact shares the same motif, which would genuinely make sense thematically if you know what "La Revacholiere" refers to (major spoilers).
   * Less esoteric again: *La Revacholiere* has been adapted forward into [*Lakeland Echo*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwwNpbRm-C8) on *Everything was Forever* ([music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvjV7d-f6qs))*.*
   * Also note, the title of *Everything was Forever* is from the book *Everything was Forever, Until it was No More: The Last Soviet Generation* \- a bit disco. It's also a lyric on [*Heavy Water*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndCGLGCYvtA) from *Valhalla Dancehall*.
* [*Advesperascist*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oBFLAQpnSQ) from the Moralist vision quest is subtly based on the [title track](https://youtube.com/watch?v=DHUes0dGjUI) from *Machineries of Joy*.
* [*Ignus Nilsen Waltz*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2hUbafQCII) from the Communist vision quest is similarly based on [*Moley and Me*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E4HDE3zZGs), from the *Decline* B-sides.
* The song Harry [sings karaoke-style](https://youtube.com/watch?v=KRZs8RLzNGk) is based on [*The Smallest Church in Sussex*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngBjEZ-uUDU), a *Decline* B-side, with the place name changed. There's also a [piano version](https://youtube.com/watch?v=7iC9RE-dvag) and an [harmonium instrumental](https://youtube.com/watch?v=UYA72ta-1FY).
* My final pull, [the Fritte (sic!) theme](https://youtube.com/watch?v=DIgl4U8fAKE) does not appear on any official soundtrack release but is based on [*French Pornographic Novel*](https://seapower.bandcamp.com/track/french-pornographic-novel) from [*BSP EP1*](https://seapower.bandcamp.com/album/gcr006-bsp-ep1). [Orb 161](https://fayde.co.uk/orbmode), in Fritte, says "A melancholy pop song plays on the radio".

**Textual**

* [Orb 279](https://fayde.co.uk/orbmode), inspecting the trash container behind the Whirling, shows that the municipal motto of Revachol is "A Light Above Descending". This is [a track](https://youtube.com/watch?v=w1cWjeW_6qY) from *Machineries of Joy*. It's a fun one because the next line in the song is "For you I am returning"..
* There is a Thought named [Cleaning Out the Rooms](https://discoelysium.wiki.gg/wiki/Cleaning_Out_the_Rooms), for which end of the solution and the completion effects flavour text directly quote [the lyrics](https://genius.com/Sea-power-cleaning-out-the-rooms-lyrics) from the song of the same name. Motifs from the song heavily feature in the OST as described above.
* The noise made by the Kineema's radio [is described](https://fayde.co.uk/dialojue/7760072) as "The soft purr of electrical kittens". [*Electrical Kittens*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRRsutYMki4) is a track on *Let the Dancers Inherit the Party*.
* It's fairly well known that the name of the Whirling-In-Rags hostel is a reference to a Sea Power song, called [*Hail Holy Queen*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z44AfnvS6_g). Garte [quotes](https://fayde.co.uk/dialojue/281189) the lyrics, calling the band "The Etenniers". If you know what the name means, please let me know. Vaguely related fun fact, in the novel they quote *Long, Long, Long* by the Beatles, although they don't refer to name of the band.
* The Paledriver [quotes](https://fayde.co.uk/dialojue/2070271) the lyrics to [*Motorway South*](https://seapower.bandcamp.com/track/motorway-south) from *EP2*, and there is a [thought](https://discoelysium.wiki.gg/wiki/Motorway_South) about it with the same name.
* Harry [says](https://fayde.co.uk/dialojue/80059) "Allons-y, let's go!" which is a line in [*No Lucifer*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGLWwHcCnxw) from [*Do You Like Rock Music?*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_You_Like_Rock_Music%3F) (2008). This one might be a reach.
* A character who is a major spoiler [uses the phrase](https://fayde.co.uk/dialojue/7620885) "Draped myself in greenery" which is a reference to [*North Hanging Rock*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0552fdLLUyw) from [*Open Season*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Season_(Sea_Power_album)) (2005).
* The dialogue that offers you the "Kingdom of Conscience" thought on the Moralist vision quest [uses the phrase](https://fayde.co.uk/dialojue/5270033) "Increment by increment", which is a repeated line on the popular track [*Remember Me*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua4BiBV6i6o) from *The Decline of British Sea Power*. The song's refrain of "Did you notice when you began to disappear?" might strike a chord particularly for anyone who's read the novel.
* [*Shit Factory*](https://seapower.bandcamp.com/track/shit-factory) is [referenced](https://fayde.co.uk/dialojue/10540047) energetically by Limbic System at the end of the second dream sequence, as well as [by Shanky](https://fayde.co.uk/dialojue/6400329) in the Hardie Boys booth. The song is from the EP [*Valhalla V.I.P.*](https://seapower.bandcamp.com/album/valhalla-v-i-p) which had a limited release alongside *Valhalla Dancehall*.
* While we're on the subject, the name of the game itself could be inspired by the title of that album - both are composed of the name of a mythical afterlife and a genre of music put together.
* The [taxidermy bird](https://fayde.co.uk/dialojue/130501) Harry has broken at the Whirling is a specimen of the Great Skua, which is the name of [a track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaBcEav4nJA) from *Do You Like Rock Music?*.
* Here's a track called [*Out of My Mind on Dope and Speed*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QnMTByjQfM)
* The ice bear fridge in the Doomed Commercial Area is a reference to the band's polar bear mascot costume, which was a fixture at live shows earlier in their career, and can be seen in the [video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1yE0goo9Eig) for *Monsters of Sunderland*. Argo Tuulik confirmed this in the interview with The 41st Precinct.
* Joyce [mentions](https://fayde.co.uk/dialojue/6320056) a "fear of drowning -- within one's own corpse" with regard to the tradition behind the body's tattoos. [*Fear of Drowning*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeeFgxuBtnI) is a track on *The Decline of British Sea Power* and prior to that was their first single, released in 2001.
* The *Decline*-era single [*Childhood Memories*](https://youtu.be/i3FdK9nFYCM) (2002) has a narrative which is reminiscent of the People's Pile disaster.

If you know any more origins or references please absolutely let me know, I'll edit this post with any new ones I find. I still have some old demo tracks I haven't listened to, there are probably some I have heard but didn't notice the similarity on too, and the number of references made by the writers is probably much more than I have here. It's probably impractical find every last one of them, given the size of the text and how lots are bound to be more subtle. I messed around trying to use [an algorithm](https://github.com/irismessage/disco-dialogue-match/) to find any direct quotes but didn't glean anything much new.

Lots of this would probably be better off on the wiki too, I had a small page about the soundtrack on the Fandom one before which just had info about where/when each track plays in the game but it got deleted because they didn't think it was relevant or fit the right template or something? Don't think I even got the text I wrote back. I've only just seen that the new wiki is open now too, I might port some info to there myself but I put this post under a CC BY-SA 4.0 license right now anyway. Feel free to use it for videos or anything too.
